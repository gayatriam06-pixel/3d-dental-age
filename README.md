Age Estimation from 3D Dental Casts

An AI model to help in the forensic age estimation of an individual with 3D dental casts.



### Why 3D Dental Casts?

These were found to be more accurate and reliable than their conventional 2D counterpart.



### Current Limitations

Sample size is too small(n=70). However, we will build a proof-of-concept.



### Summary

Feature-based ML using global 3D morphology, not per-tooth segmentation





#### Why we consider global 3D morphology, not local.

Age-related dental changes affect not only individual teeth but also the overall morphology of the dental arch due to cumulative wear, occlusal flattening, and remodeling. Therefore, global 3D descriptors were used to capture these cumulative effects.
