# Project Index — Age Estimation from 3D Dental Casts

This document serves as a structural index of the repository, describing the
purpose of each directory and key file. It is intended to improve readability,
reproducibility, and maintainability of the project.

---

## Root Files

- **README.md**  
  High-level overview of the project, objectives, methodology summary, and setup instructions.

- **INDEX.md**  
  Repository map describing the role of each folder and file (this document).

- **.gitignore**  
  Specifies files and directories excluded from version control.  
  Raw STL dental cast data is intentionally excluded for ethical and privacy reasons.

- **requirements.txt**  
  Lists Python dependencies required to run the feature extraction and modeling pipeline.

---

## Data Directory (`data/`)

Contains all data-related files. Raw data is excluded from version control.

### `data/raw/`
- **stl/** *(ignored by git)*  
  Contains original 3D dental cast files in STL format (upper and lower jaws).
- **labels.csv** *(optional, may also be ignored)*  
  Maps sample IDs to chronological age and jaw type.

### `data/processed/`
- **features.csv**  
  Extracted global 3D morphological features used for machine learning.
- **cleaned_features.csv** *(optional)*  
  Processed or filtered feature set used for final modeling.

---

## Source Code (`src/`)

All executable Python code is organized here.

### `src/config.py`
Central configuration file defining paths, random seeds, and cross-validation settings.

### `src/preprocessing/`
Handles STL loading and feature extraction.
- **extract_features.py**  
  Extracts global 3D morphological descriptors from STL meshes.

### `src/models/`
Model training logic.
- **train_model.py**  
  Trains regression models (e.g., Random Forest) for age estimation.

### `src/evaluation/`
Model evaluation and validation.
- **evaluate.py**  
  Performs cross-validation and computes MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics.

---

## Results (`results/`)

Contains outputs generated by running the pipeline. No source code is stored here.

### `results/figures/`
- Plots such as predicted vs. actual age and feature importance visualizations.

### `results/metrics/`
- JSON or CSV files containing quantitative performance metrics.

### `results/models/`
- Serialized trained models (e.g., `.pkl` files), typically excluded from git if large.

---

## Artifacts (`artifacts/`)

Non-code assets used in reports, presentations, or thesis documentation.
- Pipeline flowcharts
- Methodology diagrams
- Example 3D mesh visualizations

---

## Notebooks (`notebooks/`)

Optional exploratory analysis and visualization.
- Used for debugging or inspection only
- Core logic is implemented in `src/`

---

## Notes

- The project follows a feature-based machine learning approach due to limited sample size.
- Global 3D morphological descriptors are used instead of tooth-level segmentation.
- The repository is structured to support reproducibility while respecting data privacy.
